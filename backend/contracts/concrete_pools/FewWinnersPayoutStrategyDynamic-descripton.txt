Few Winners Payout Strategy Dynamic implementation

This pool implements a payout strategy where the number of winners is dynamic based on the number of participants in the pool.

Rules:

Admin can add winners and the payout is distributed among them.
Admin can change his role to a regular member.
At least 1 winner is required.

At least 1 approval for the payout scheme is required. Explanation:
    * When admin proposes a payout scheme, he needs to get at least 1 approval from the members.
    * This approval should be done by a regular member who is not the admin and not the payout recipient.
Payout scheme is something that all members need to agree to.

Admin has access to the editable table of winners.
In this table, admin is able for each row to set:
    - winner
    - share in percentage

Admin will click "Payout" button when event is finished

Supposedly, there can be other strategies, for example:
    Strategy 75-winner1/15-winner2/10-winner3
    Strategy 100-winner1 (this is the same as OneWinnerPool)
    etc.
